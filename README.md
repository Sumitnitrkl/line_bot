This codes are all about line follower robotic car.
A line follower robot is a robot which follows a certain path controlled by a feed back mechanism.
Building a basic line follower robot:
Designing the mechanical part or the body of the robot
Defining the kinematics of the robots
Designing the control of the robot
The mechanical part or body of the robot can be designed using AutoCAD or Workspace. A basic Line follower robot can consist of a base at the two ends of which the wheels are mounted. 
A rectangular sheet of hard plastic can be used as the base. Further a rigid body like a cylinder can be added along with other shaped bodies inter connected with each other by joints, and each with its defined motion in particular direction. 
The Line follower robot can be a wheeled mobile robot with a fixed base, a legged mobile robot with multiple rigid bodies interconnected by joints.
it consists of an IR-LED and Photodiode arrangement for each motor which is controlled by the switching on and off of the transistor.
The IR LED on getting proper biasing emits Infra red light. This IR light is reflected in case of a white surface and the reflected IR light is incident on the photodiode. The resistance of the photodiode decreases, which leads to an increase in current through it and thus the voltage drop across it. 
The photodiode is connected to the base of the transistor and as a result of increased voltage across the photodiode, the transistor starts conducting and thus the motor connected to the collector of the transistor gets enough supply to start rotating. In case of a black color on the path encountered by one of the sensor arrangement, the IR light is not reflected and the photodiode offers more resistance, causing the transistor to stop conduction and eventually the motor stops rotating.
Applications of line follower robot:
Industrial Applications: These robots can be used as automated equipment carriers in industries replacing traditional conveyer belts.
Automobile applications: These robots can also be used as automatic cars running on roads with embedded magnets.
Domestic applications: These can also be used at homes for domestic purposes like floor cleaning etc.
Guidance applications: These can be used in public places like shopping malls, museums etc to provide path guidance.
Advantages:
Robot movement is automatic
It is used for long distance applications
Simplicity of building
Fit and forget system
Used in home, industrial automations etc.
